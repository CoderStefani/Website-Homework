    <p class= "Bio">
    My name is Stefani Walker. My road to becominning a developer has been nothing short of unconventional. 
    I'm a Georgia State University graduate and while there I stuided Psychology and Public relations and graduated 
    with a degree in both fields. My college experience was very fulfilling. However, I felt personally unfulfilled 
    after five years of working in social services and hitting roadblocks when trying to revolutionize the industry. 
    After leaving that industry I quickly transitioned into the Instructional Design and Technology field by volunteering
    for a comoany called 24/7 Teach and Learn. While volunteering in the curriculum design department
     I noticed that there were many ways in which the e-development software could improve. 
    I'm so excited to be in a space where I am around individuals who are just as motivated and inspired to 
    push the limits as developers. The rocky road on the scenic route will be well worth the ride!
